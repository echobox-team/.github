# Hello! 👋

We are the **Echobox Team**.

We are an academic group dedicated to developing **Echobox**, a feedback management system inspired by platforms like *Reclame Aqui*, but designed with a strong focus on **usability**, **clarity**, and an improved **visual experience**.

The project was developed for the courses **Web Development Framework** and **Backend: Webservices**, applying best practices in architecture, code quality, and technical evolution throughout the process.

### 2. `Echobox_java` — Spring Boot API

A rebuilt version of the Echobox API for the **Backend: Webservices** course, now developed with **Java + Spring Boot**.

Highlights:

* More robust and well-structured API
* Automatic documentation with **Swagger**
* Controllers and Services with **unit tests implemented**
* Authentication using **JWT**

Se quiser, posso também revisar a gramática, deixar mais formal, mais técnico, ou criar uma versão totalmente minimalista.
